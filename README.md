# Yahoo Finance Cinnamon Desklet

![Screenshot](/capture.png)

## Description

This is a simple desklet to add sticky notes in the desktop.
The sticky notes will be saved when a focus of the text editor was lost.

This repository contains the directory "yahoostocks@fthuin". You can
download it and move it in ~/.local/share/cinnamon/desklets/

This will shows (by default every 10 minutes) updated data from Yahoo
Finance on your cinnamon desktop. You can choose which quotes you want to display
in yahoostocks@fthuin/stocks.list by removing or adding quotes symbols.

This desklet was inspired by the stocks applet from adonut
(http://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/applets/view/187) but it retrieved
data from Google Finance API which is deprecated.

Tested with Linux Mint 17.2 / Cinnamon 2.6.13 (Fully functional)
